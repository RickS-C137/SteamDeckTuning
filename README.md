# SteamDeckTuning
A script for tuning Linux parameter of SteamOS. It's based on this article: https://medium.com/@a.b.t./here-are-some-possibly-useful-tweaks-for-steamos-on-the-steam-deck-fcb6b571b577#333e

Two of the tuning tips have been set as a default in SteamOS meanwhile. So I didn't include them.

tuning.sh: Apply tuning
revert.sh: Revert all changes.

You need to run the scripts with sudo.
